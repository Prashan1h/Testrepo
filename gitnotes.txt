files already on main
--> continue to be on sub branches too
--> but content changes committed on one sub branch will not reflect on other sub branches

files explicitly created inside a sub branch which is not originally part of main
--> will reflect on all the branches including main until committed (can commit in any branch         even if created as a part of a particular branch
--> once committed, remains and reflects only in the committed branch.

Balancing/ updating forked main branch with original main branch:
1)git fetch --all --prune
2) git reset --hard upstream/main
